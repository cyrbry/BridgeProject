## Engineering Drawings

1. 2D drawing showing how you plan to cut the matboard

{cutout plan.png}

- Bridge elevation, top, bottom, and cross-section views at important locations

{/Users/julianmoncarz/University/Year_1/Fall_2025/CIV102_Structures/Bridge Project/not_code/images for construction/cross_section_plot.png}

matpotlib rendering of cross section (note this does not show the 'wrapped' design, but is to scale)

{/Users/julianmoncarz/University/Year_1/Fall_2025/CIV102_Structures/Bridge Project/not_code/images for construction/3d_cross.png}

3d rendering of cross section - shows the wrapped design

{/Users/julianmoncarz/University/Year_1/Fall_2025/CIV102_Structures/Bridge Project/not_code/images for construction/drawn profile.jpg}

sketch of cross section - shows the wrapped "cigar" design

{cross_section_prototype.JPG}

Cross-section prototype


(put those 4 side by side in the pdf)

## add elevation, top and bottom views by yang



- Splice, diaphragm, and any other connection details

### add these from yang

{join_prototype.JPG}

Connection Joint Prototype - Shows splice and diaphragm joining method


- Optional: 3D rendering or 3D pencil/pen sketch of the entire bridge (if you have time)

{left_profile} {right_profile}

(Place side by side in LaTeX)

## Construction Process Documentation

### Prototype Development

**10:05 AM** - {Julian_with_cardboard.JPG}

Julian with the cardboard

**10:30 AM** - {carboard_prototype.jpg}

Initial cardboard prototype for testing if our cut out pattern works

(Place carboard_prototype and cross_section_prototype side by side)

### Cutting, Preparation and Being Neat

**10:15 AM** - {drawing_cut_guidelines.jpg}

Drawing cut guidelines - team planning cuts on matboard before cutting

**10:45 AM** - {cutting_on_carboard_for_safety.jpg} {cutting_on_cardboard.JPG}

Safe cutting setup on cardboard - shows precautions taken during cutting process

(Place these two side by side - shows safe work space)


### Cutting and creasing done

**1:20 PM** - {creased_small_box.jpg}

Creased small box section

**2:50 PM** - {both_cigars.JPG}

Completed cigar-shaped sections - both wrapped matboard sections completed and ready for assembly


### Photo Requirements

- **Timestamped, non-blurry photos** showing your work
- Add a caption or label for each photo explaining what's happening
- Include a photo showing all precautions taken to keep your building space clean (see "Safe Cutting Setup" images above)
- Include a photo of your building space at the end of each construction session

## Time log

just screenshot it and put it here when we are done
