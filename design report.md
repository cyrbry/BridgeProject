**Team Members:** [Write names here]
**Teaching Assistant:** [Write TA name here]
**Date:** November 23, 2025

---

## 1. Introduction Section
{
- Present a clear description of your bridge (write a couple of paragraphs)
- List of the key design decisions your team made (can use bullet points, write in paragraphs, use a table, or any combination of the above)
- You can include photographs or other visuals as well
}

## 2. Major Design Iterations
{
- Present three (3) to ten (10) major design iterations that your team performed before converging upon your final bridge design
- The results of each iteration should be explained using CIV102 knowledge, or from additional research that your team found online, with references
- Describe the design parameters you changed and justify your reasons (bullet points, small sentences, small paragraphs, tables, mathematical equations, labelled diagrams, or any combination of the above)
- Images can be added to the report, where appropriate. These images should include labels and/or captions. They also should not be too blurry
- You may include snippets or small screenshots of code you wrote to emphasize points. You can also include a link to an external website to showcase all of your code, if your team prefers to do that
}
